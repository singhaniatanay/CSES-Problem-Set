# CSES-Problem-Set
The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming practice problems.  The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning competitive programming. The current collection has 200 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

Below are my solutions according to the site : 
## Introductory Problems :

 - [Increasing Array](./IncreasingArray.java) 
 - [Missing Number](./MissingNumber.java) 
 - [Number Spiral](./NumberSpiral.java)
 - [Repetitions.java](./Repetitions.java)
 - [Weird Algorithm](./Weird_Algorithm.java)
